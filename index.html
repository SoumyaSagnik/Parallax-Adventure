            <h2>PARAGLIDING</h2>
            <p>
                Paragliding is a recreational and competitive sport that involves flying in a lightweight, foot-launched
                aircraft known as a paraglider. The pilot sits in a harness suspended beneath a fabric wing, which is
                inflated by the wind. The wind shape is determined by lines and a framework of ribs, similar to a
                parachute. Paragliding is launched by running down a slope with the wing overhead, or by being towed
                behind a vehicle. Once airborne, the pilot can control the wing's direction and speed by shifting their
                body weight and using steering lines. Paragliding is a relatively easy sport to learn, but it does
                require some physical fitness and training to be able to fly safely and confidently. The sport can be
                enjoyed by people of all ages and provides a unique perspective of the world as well as a sense of
                freedom and tranquility. Paragliding is also a competitive sport, with pilots competing in
                cross-country, acrobatic, and distance flying events.

            <h2>SURFING</h2>
            <p>
                Surfing is a popular water sport that involves riding on the surface of a wave while standing on a
                surfboard. It is typically done in the ocean, but can also be done in other bodies of water with
                suitable wave conditions. Surfing originated in Hawaii and has since spread to coastal communities
                around the world. It requires a combination of strength, balance, and technique to successfully ride a
                wave. Surfers typically use a combination of paddling and pop-ups to catch and ride a wave. The sport
                can be enjoyed by people of all ages, but it does require a certain level of physical fitness and skill
                to be able to catch and ride a wave. The surfer community is known for its laid-back and adventurous
                culture. Overall, surfing is a fun and challenging way to enjoy the ocean and the thrill of riding a
                wave.
